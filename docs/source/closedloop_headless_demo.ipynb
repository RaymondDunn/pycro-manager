    "# Closed-loop acquisition and perturbation with pycro-manager\n",

    "### an example of closed-loop experimentation enabled by pycro-manager\n",
    "\n",
    "When imaging live biological samples, we often have specific features of cellular activity we are interested in, such as a pattern of neural activity or stage in the cell cycle. We can interrogate these dynamics with closed-loop (CL) experimental design. CL perturbations are triggered by signals derived from data acquired from the sample itself during a live recording session. Recent advancements in computing allow experimenters to coduct closed-loop experiments, which will deeply influence optical physiology, allowing realtime adaptation to animal state, enforcement of physiological constraints on evoked patterns, calibrated control with cellular resolution, and a variety of important experimental controls that were previously inaccessible (Grosenick, Marshel, and Deisseroth 2016 Neuron). Specifically, CL experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ensure perturbation occurs during statistically rare conditions\n",
    "* allow online tuning of optogenetic inputs in vivo (to achieve specific output parameters)\n",
    "* allow online system identification / modeling of neural circuits (i.e. causally establish functional circuit architecture)\n",
    "* steer the system into desired or otherwise non-observable states\n",
    "* eliminate off-target effects of non-closed-loop perturbations\n",
    "* reduce variability of system state at time of stimulus onset\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we use features of pycro-manager which enable closed-loop experimentation. Specifically we perform some canonical image processing (template filtering with 2d gaussian kernel, thresholding, median filtering), then find local peaks, then take a window of pixel values around each peak. We use these pixel values to trigger our arbitrary \"stimulus\" function which can e.g. change optical settings on the microscope, call a separate program, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use snap_image() to acquire our images for readability and to show an example of headless pycromanager acquisition. Alternatively one could use pycro-manager Acquisitions to run our closed-loop experiment. We also leverage a few neat tricks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* we strobe our imaging acquisition by introducing a small delay between images. This makes snap_image() timing an order of magnitude more accurate, and reflects a common imaging condition for perturbative experiments, and gives our closed-loop processing algorithm time to perform computation.\n",
    "* we use the python package numba to just-in-time compile our closed-loop computation into LLVM intermediate representation. This affords an order-of-magnitude speedup, as numba-compiled numerical algorithms can allow Python code to approach the speeds of C.\n",
